The first maturation in American oak, ex-bourbon barrels, and then transferred into small 19th century style Quarter Casks for a second maturation. The final maturation is in specially selected, large European oak, Oloroso sherry casks. The result is a wonderfully rich and powerful Islay single malt.\n\n**Glenfiddich 18 Year**\n\n\n![Glenfiddich](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/901411_5_9999_med_v1_m56577569854527434.png)\n\n\nThe Glenfiddich 18 Year Old Ancient Reserve is a truly superb single malt aged in Oloroso (Sherry) and Bourbon casks. This has created an amazingly smooth, mellow, and full flavoured whisky.\n\n\n**Sullivan's Cove American Oak Cask Single Malt**\n\n\n![Sullivan's Cove](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/375577_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854546121.png)\n\nSullivans Cove Single Cask American Oak Whisky is double distilled using Tasmanian barley and only the purest wilderness water from Tasmania's mountains and forests. Matured in hand selected American Oak Bourbon casks and allowed to settle and clear naturally, this single malt retains full, creamy lingering flavours. Each cask is bottled separately, yielding only around 250 bottles, making this our rarest Sullivans Cove Single Malt Whisky.\n\n**Jameson Reserve 18 Year**\n\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rFYWniAm.png)\n\n\nFirst introduced in 2002, Jameson 18 Year Old is the Master Blender, Billy Leighton's hand picked selection of very old Jameson Irish Whiskey, aged in oak casks for at least 18 years. Rich, complex and truly rare, only limited stocks of this exceptional whiskey are available, thus each bottle is individually numbered.\n\n**Bruichladdich Islay Barley Scotch**\n\n\n![Bruicladdich](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/786834_1_9999_med_v1_m56577569854701930.png)\n\n\nBruichladdich's Islay Barley is the ultimate expression of provenance: single malt, single barley variety, single harvest and even a single field! Islay Barley is unpeated for maximum barley flavour, non-chill filtered and colouring free. The Whisky is matured in American oak casks that are located in Bruichladdich's coldest warehouse. This is a fascinating exploration of the \"terroir\" of single malt Whisky.\n\n**Lagavulin 16 Year**\n\n\n![Lagavulin](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/41788_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854546437.png)\n\n\nThis peaty Single Malt dates back to 1816, when John Johnston and Archibald Campbell each constructed a distillery on what today is the Lagavulin site. After Johnston died, Campbell consolidated the two, before selling it to malt merchant Alexander Graham. Today it continues to uphold the traditions of its past, using meticulous preparation to create powerful whisky. Their signature 16 year old malt has a strong peat, smoke and seaweed nose that is followed by a nutty complexity and light fruitiness. In the mouth characters of Charcoal, dry woodiness and iodine followed by chilli chocolate and a hint of toffee.\n\n**Ardbeg 10 Year Old Scotch Whisky**\n\n\n![Ardbeg](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/903743_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854673426.png)\n\n\nArdbeg 10 Year Old Single Malt is typical Islay (eye-la). Light gold colour with exceptional balance and depth on the nose. The aroma is a beguiling mix of toffee and chocolate sweetness, cinnamon spice, Fresh citrus and floral notes of white wine are evident, as are melon, pear drops and a gentle creaminess. There is also fresh phenolics of seaspray and smoked fish. Hickory and coffee emerge on the finish.\n\n**Bunnahabhain  12 Year Old**\n\n\n![Bunnahabhain](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/760659_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854531611.png)\n\n\nSince inception in 1881, Bunnahabhain has been producing an Islay malt a little different from most. By not heavily peating their malted barley, the resulting whisky is a clean, pure and distinctive malt. Embodying the 'gentle taste of Islay', Bunnahabhain 12 Year Old is an approachable, welcoming whisky. Ex-sherry cask influence and being non-chill filtered add to the layers of complexity exuding from this premium whisky.\n\n\n**Glenmorangie 18 Year Old Extremely Rare**\n\n\n![Glenmorangie](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/824073_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569855037782.png)\n\n\nGlenmorangie 18 Year Old Scotch Whisky slips like silk over the tongue with a full, rounded flavour, starting with grapefruit & orange. The palate is then entranced with an accord of melting honey, creamy malt and aromatic florals that segue into the warm, syrupy nuttiness of hazelnuts and walnuts from the Oloroso sherry casks in which the whisky is matured. Savour the rich, sticky date and fig flavours as they are heightened by the unexpected caress of woodsmoke.\n\n\n**Yamazaki 12 Year Old**\n\n\n![Yamazaki](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/903363_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854527489.png)\n\n\nLeading Japanese Whisky with aromas of dried fruit and honey. It has a delicate, mellow taste with a lingering woody dry finish. For Scotch drinkers looking for something different.\n\n\n**Glengoyne Single Malt Scotch Whiskey 2000**\n\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mzRsLFum.jpg)\n\nGlengoyne boasts to be the only distillery that uses no peated barley. Located near the southern fringes of the Trossachs, the distillery sits prettily at the foot of Dumgoyne Hill from which a 50 foot waterfall cascades into the grounds. Matured in a first fill sherry cask, this fine dram exudes rich fig and burnt orange peel notes. The fruity sweet palate is balanced by some oak tannins and there is a syrupy intensity which lingers long into the finish.\n\n\n**Talisker Port Ruighe**\n\n![Talisker](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/784436_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854701927.png)\n\nDouble matured in port casks, this malt is a toast to the Scottish traders who braved the high seas and were instrumental in founding the port wine trade, shipping it to the world. 'Port Ruighe' (pronounced 'Portree') is the Gaelic spelling of the once bustling trading port on Skye. The Port finish combines Talisker's powerful maritime character with succulent sweet notes of rich berry fruits for a superb contrasting taste experience.\n\n\n**Hakushu Single Malt Aged 12 Years**\n\n![Hakushu](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/media/DM/Product/308x385/784473_0_9999_med_v1_m56577569854701952.png)\n\nThe Hakushu Distillery is know as the 'Mountain Forest Distillery' as it stands amidst fresh streams and lush forests. Built with the notion, 'Coexisting with nature', a bird sanctuary was set up to help preserve the natural environment, thus preserving the pristine water that goes into creating the whisky. The 12 year old single malt whisky has a crisp and vibrant taste and can be enjoyed on neat, on the rocks or with ice and soda water.\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><strong>Laphroaig Triple Wood</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lK1tGwPm.jpg\" alt=\"Laphroaig Triple Wood\" /></p>\n\n<p>Laphroaig Triple Wood has enjoyed a triple maturation in 3 types of cask.

The nose offers powerful sweet grainy scents, beautifully integrated with cocoa, charry vanillan oak and a very soft, gently wafting sweet peat adding depth. There’s a subtle grapiness too. Concentrated and mouth filling by blended standards and quite spicy, the palate is pristinely clean offering rich sweet malt, followed by cocoa and some smoky, honeyed, biscuit flavours.

Wicklow, is this fantastic whiskey is 4 years old and aged in Sherry and Bourbon barrels and  weighs in at a 42% alcohol content.\n\n---\n*Glendalough Distillery is a young distillery set up by five friends from Wicklow and Dublin. It is one of few distilleries trying to revive the once booming distilling industry in Ireland.*\n\n*Their aim is to make innovative spirits while staying true to the tradition and heritage of their ancestors.*\n\n*They started with the classic Irish spirit poitín (pronounced pot-cheen), before moving on to whiskey and most recently seasonal, wild botanical gins.*\n\n---\n\n>This single grain will blast the cobwebs off the Irish whiskey category. A new and unique style of light and floral whiskey distilled in a Coffey still (like whiskey, another great Irish invention!) from a mash bill of Irish malted barley and corn. \n\n>It spends three and a half years in American oak first-fill Bourbon barrels before being finished for six months in Spanish Oloroso sherry casks. \n\n>The Bourbon barrels impart deep, robust chocolate and caramel notes, while the Oloroso casks lighten the palate with fruitier notes and touches of nutty tones. \n\n>With both barrels being oak, you get that beautiful vanilla thread you’d expect to run through an Irish whiskey. Both barrels are porous too, allowing Ireland’s temperate, maritime air through to make its impression. \n\n> *- http://www.glendaloughdistillery.com/*\n\n<br>\n####What they say...\n\n*TASTING NOTES:*\n\n**The nose** is slight but undoubtedly rich with dark fruit; cherry, raisin, fig (with Christmas pudding notes on the nose for those lucky enough to know what that is) along with floral lemongrass and a touch of nutmeg.\n\n**The taste** is sweet and creamy on the palate, with butterscotch, honey and peppercorn bringing along sweet Bourbon Cask notes with dried fruit returning through notes of maraschino cherries and a pinch of brown sugar.\n\n**The finish** has lingering notes of ginger spices with a faint glimmer of almond to end a complex Irish Whiskey from start to finish.\n\n\n####What we say...\nTASTING NOTES:\n\n**The nose** gives a soft, light smell. Smells like sweets from your childhood. Floral fruity flavours coming through too. A subtle hint of vanilla present in the glass afterwards. Some citrus and a bit of spicy cinnamon.\n\n**The taste** hints at a nutty taste at first which subsides. Super smooth and creamy.

The distillery is located on the eastern outskirts of Aberfeldy, on the southern bank of the upper Tay.\n\nThe demand for barley as a basic foodstuff during World War I led to the distillery being closed from 1917 to 1919. The Second World War also caused barley supplies to be cut, and the distillery was again forced to shut down for some of this period. Supply to final markets was kept up by reducing the period whisky was laid up from 7 years to 3.\n\nIn 1972 the distillery was enlarged, and the old stills were replaced by four new steam heated stills. In 1999, an Aberfeldy 12 Year Old Single Malt brand was introduced. In 2000, the Earl of Elgin opened \"Dewar's World of Whisky\" at the Aberfeldy Distillery: this is a centre for marketing the products and educating the public about the process of distillation and history of the Dewar's brand.\n\nAberfeldy is the largest malt whisky component of Dewar's Blended Whisky\n\nAberfeldy is situated in the centre of Scotland, some five miles east of Loch Tay and the town of Kenmore and about eight miles south of Loch Tummel. Aberfeldy relies on the fresh water stream Pitilie Burn, which runs alongside the distillery. Aberfeldy is the only distillery in Scotland to use these waters. Aberfeldy uses only Scottish barley, yeast and water.\n\nThe area contains historical landmarks, such as Kenmore Bridge. This was built by the 3rd Earl in 1774 and the view from it was the inspiration for Robert Burns's poem on the chimney piece of the Kenmore Inn.\n\nThe distillery has two wash stills with a capacity of about 16,500 liter and two spirit stills with 15,000 liters. With these capacities the Aberfeldy distillery lies in the middle of the range of pot still sizes.\n<div style=\"float:right; font-size: 10px\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberfeldy_distillery\">Source: wikipedia</a></div>\n\n---\n\n####Details:\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Style</td><td>Single Malt, Scotch</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Region</td><td>Highlands</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Alcohol</td><td>40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Cask Type</td><td>Oak Cask</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n---\n\n####Our Score:\n\n\n<style>\n.grey {\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\ntd {\n    border: 2px solid lightgrey;\n}\n\ntable {\n    width: 50%;\n    border: 2px solid lightgrey;\n\n}\n\n</style>\n<table class=\"score-table\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Nose</td><td>7/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Taste</td><td>8/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\">Finish</td><td>8/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"grey\"><strong>Overall</strong></td><td><strong>8/10</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### Comments\n\"Lots of sweet Liquorice on the nose\"\n\n\"Sweet and smooth taste\"\n\n\"Quality body, smooth and even all across the tongue\"\n\n\"It's smooth but really only because of the low 40% alcohol content, any higher and we think it'll be quite harsh\"\n\n\"Reminds me of Chivas Regal\"\n\n**Overall:** \n\nWe think this is a very morish whiskey.

When a new lease for the distillery was negotiated with the chief of Clan MacLeod in 1892 the annual payment was to be £23.12s and a ten-gallon cask of best-quality Talisker. It was rebuilt in 1960 after a stillhouse fire completely destroyed the distillery. \n\nThe distillery operates five stills; two wash stills and three spirit stills. All the stills use worm tubs (condensing coils) rather than a modern condenser, which are believed to give the whisky a \"fuller\" flavour (itself an indication of higher sugar content). \n\nDuring this early period, the whisky was produced using a triple distilling method, but changed to the more conventional double distilling in 1928. Talisker was acquired by Distillers Company in 1925 and is now part of Diageo. \n\nAfter the 1960 fire, five exact replicas of the original stills were constructed to preserve the original Talisker flavour. In 1972 the stills were converted to steam heating and the maltings floor was demolished. Talisker’s water comes from springs directly above the distillery via a network of pipes and wells.\n\nThe malted barley used in production comes from Muir of Ord. Talisker has an unusual feature—swan neck lye pipes. A loop in the pipes takes the vapour from the stills to the worm tubs so some of the alcohol already condenses before it reaches the cooler. It then runs back in to the stills and is distilled again. Talisker now has an annual output of three and a half million litres of spirit.\n\nTalisker was the favourite whisky of writers Robert Louis Stevenson and HV Morton.

The Johnstons who founded Laphroaig were from the Clan Donald and are likely to be from the MacIain of Ardnamurchan branch of the clan. The family anglicised their name to Johnston. The last member of the Johnston family to run the distillery was Ian Hunter, a nephew of Sandy Johnston, who died childless in 1954 and left the distillery to one of his managers, Bessie Williamson.\n\n>The distillery was sold to Long John International in the 1960s, and subsequently became part of Allied Domecq. The brand was in turn acquired by Fortune Brands in 2005, as one of the brands divested by Pernod Ricard in order to obtain regulatory approval for its takeover of Allied Domecq. Fortune Brands then split up its business product lines in 2011, forming its spirits business into Beam Inc. Beam was then purchased by Suntory Holdings in April 2014.\n\n>Laphroaig has been the only whisky to carry the Royal Warrant of the Prince of Wales, which was awarded in person during a visit to the distillery in 1994. The 15-year-old was reportedly the prince's favourite Scotch whisky. \n\n> ####The Taste\n>Laphroaig calls itself one of the most strongly flavoured of all Scotch whiskies, and is most frequently aged to 10 years, although the 15-year-old variety is common (the 27-, 30- and 40-year-olds are rare and expensive; the 18-year-old was discontinued in late 2015).[3] The whisky has a peaty/smoky flavour.\n\n>The Laphroaig Quarter Cask was introduced in 2004. This expression is aged in smaller casks and is not chill filtered. Due to the smaller barrels used, the oak surface contact is 30% greater than with standard barrels. The company describes the effect of this as \"creating a soft and velvety edge\".[7] The Quarter Cask is bottled at 48% ABV (96 proof).[8] The standard bearer 10-year-old bottling is bottled at 40% or 43% ABV dependent on the locality where it's purchased.[8]\n\n>There are also expressions now selling in Travel Retail: Laphroaig QA cask (matured in ex-bourbon barrels and virgin American oak casks), Laphroaig PX cask (matured in three types of wood – from American oak to Quarter Cask to Pedro Ximenez ex-sherry), Laphroaig An Cuan Mor – Big Ocean (matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and then in European oak). -- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laphroaig_distillery)\n\n\n---\n\n###Details\n<table>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Style</td><td>Single Malt</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Region</td><td>Scotch</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Alcohol</td><td>48%</td>  \n</tr>  \n</table>\n\n\n---\n\n###Our Score\n<table class=\"score-table\">  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Nose</td><td>8.3/10</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Taste</td><td>8.5/10</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Finish</td><td>8/10</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\"><strong>Overall</strong></td><td><strong>8/10</strong></td>  \n</tr>  \n</table>\n\n---\n\n### Comments\n\"The king of peat, its very strong, the first sip you can feel the burn.

Now used only by a select few who continue, like Glenmorangie, to uphold an ethos of sacrificing yield for quality by using only the finest ingredients, the result is a whisky celebrating the variety’s renowned taste profile.\n\n[Source: Glenmorangie Distillery](https://www.glenmorangie.com/en-uk/our-whiskies/tusail-2015)\n\n---\n\n###Our Take\nHaving tried and enjoyed two Private Edition's previously, the expectations were set high for this tasting.

Jameson was a Scottish lawyer from Alloa in Clackmannanshire who had married Margaret Haig, a sister of the Haig brothers who owned the Haig distilleries. Margaret Haig was a first cousin of the Steins, a Scottish distilling family, also from Clackmannanshire, with significant distilling interests in Scotland and Dublin. On his marriage to Margaret Haig in 1786, John Jameson moved with his new wife to Dublin to manage the Stein's Bow Street Distillery (which had been established in 1780) for Margaret's Stein uncle.

The distillery uses barley grown on site at Rockside Farm and malted at the distillery, as well as malt from the Port Ellen maltings and releases separate bottlings depending on the source of the grain.\n\nIt is one of only six Scottish distilleries still doing traditional floor-maltings, and will be unique in having all parts of the process - growing barley, malting, distilling, maturing and bottling - carried out on Islay.\n\nThe distillery first filled casks on 14 December 2005 and the distillery began bottling 3-year-old single malt in September 2009.

Appeals to the darker side of human nature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finish:</strong> \nPowerful ashtray. Like we had just had a smoke. This will indeed appeal to smokers. Easy end. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"details\">Details</h3>\n\n<table>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Style</td><td>Moonshine</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Region</td><td>Southern Australia</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Alcohol</td><td>40%</td>  \n</tr>  \n</table>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 id=\"ourscore\">Our Score</h3>\n\n<table class=\"score-table\">  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Aroma</td><td>3/10</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Taste</td><td>5/10</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\">Finish</td><td>5/10</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td class=\"grey\"><strong>Overall</strong></td><td><strong>4/10</strong></td>  \n</tr>  \n</table>","image":"/content/images/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-4.26.22-pm.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":4,"created_at":"2017-10-27 05:27:21","created_by":4,"updated_at":"2017-11-03 03:29:28","updated_by":4,"published_at":"2017-10-27 05:27:00","published_by":4,"amp":null},{"id":140,"uuid":"073ec216-9d07-40bf-b10e-00acc2510b31","title":"The Chita - Suntory Whisky","slug":"the-chita-suntory-whisky","markdown":"###From the Distiller\nThis single grain whisky was made with diverse unblended whisky brewing techniques and master craftsmanship developed over many years at the Chita Distillery in Aichi Prefecture.

It is named for the area of land at the head of Loch Laphroaig on the south coast of the Isle of Islay. The meaning of the toponym is unknown, but a commonly suggested etymology includes the elements \"lag\" (Gaelic: hollow), \"breid\" (Norse: broad) and \"vik\" (Norse: bay), implying an original Gaelic form something like \"Lag Bhròdhaig\" (the hollow of Broadbay). The name may be related to a placename on the east coast of Islay, \"Pròaig\", again suggested as meaning \"broad bay\". The distillery and brand are owned and operated by Beam Suntory, the American subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings.\n\nThe Laphroaig distillery was established in 1815 by Donald and Alexander Johnston. The Johnstons who founded Laphroaig were from the Clan Donald and are likely to be from the MacIain of Ardnamurchan branch of the clan. The family anglicised their name to Johnston. The last member of the Johnston family to run the distillery was Ian Hunter, a nephew of Sandy Johnston, who died childless in 1954 and left the distillery to one of his managers, Bessie Williamson.\n\nThe distillery was sold to Long John International in the 1960s, and subsequently became part of Allied Domecq. The brand was in turn acquired by Fortune Brands in 2005, as one of the brands divested by Pernod Ricard in order to obtain regulatory approval for its takeover of Allied Domecq. Fortune Brands then split up its business product lines in 2011, forming its spirits business into Beam Inc. Beam was then purchased by Suntory Holdings in April 2014.\n\nLaphroaig has been the only whisky to carry the Royal Warrant of the Prince of Wales, which was awarded in person during a visit to the distillery in 1994. The distillery identifies Charles by his title of Duke of Rothesay, as he is recognised in Scotland. The 15-year-old was reportedly the prince's favourite Scotch whisky.\n\n[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laphroaig_distillery)\n\n---\n\n###Our Take\n\n**Sight:**\nIt presents itself in the traditional Laphroaig green bottle that we've come to know and love. Pours a lovely gold.\n\n**Aroma:** \nAs soon as it's pouring the aroma holds no punches. The smell is bold and the peat is extreme. Like a bonfire. It lingers throughout the tasting. Very intense.\n\n**Flavour:** \nIt continues to deliver the peat the aroma promised. Full smoke while incredibly smooth. It's one of the peatiest whiskeys we have tasted to date. Flavour that lasts for days. An all expenses paid journey to whiskey town. Amazing.\n\n**Finish:** \nThe charcoal lingers like embers. It never leaves you. A smoke lover's paradise. wood fire in a campground. Extremely long finish.\n\n**Thoughts:**\nWe were told to expect a world of peat and it didn't disappoint. \nAn excellent dram.
